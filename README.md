Python Tic Tac Toe
========
A typical Tic Tac Toe game written in [Python](http://www.python.org/)

Dependencies
========
[Python 2.x](http://www.python.org/).

Installation
========
If you're using OSX, Python 2.x is likely already installed. If not, you can install it using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) with:

```
brew install python
```

Playing
========
To play, clone the repo and then cd into it. After that, type:

```
python play.py
```

Testing
========
You can run the tests using pytest. It's easy to [install py.test](http://pytest.org/latest/getting-started.html) yourself. I recommend using [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip), which Homebrew will automatically install.

```
pip install -U pytest
```

If you've installed py.test yourself, you can simply use the following command to run the tests:

```
py.test
```

The tests are written using [PyUnit](http://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html).
